    <p><b>Israel has received a list of hostages to be freed from Gaza on Saturday by Palestinian militant group Hamas, officials said, following the release of 24 hostages the previous day, the first of a planned four-day truce</p></b>
    <p><b>Israeli security officials were reviewing the list, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement, after his government's vow to work for the release of all hostages taken by Hamas in an attack on Israel on Oct. 7.</p></b>
    <h2>Goal from 30m out, Ronaldo shows he still got it at 38!</h2>
    <img src="https://sajidulhaqchy.github.io/hw1/images/cr7.jpg">
    <p><b>At 38, Ronaldo still has what it takes to mesmerise fans and football lovers. The Portuguese superstar scored a brace inside three minutes, including a goal from about 30 metres out, in Al Nassr's 3-0 win over Al Akhdoud in the Saudi Pro League yesterday.
        </br>
        Al Nassr have now closed the title gap to one point behind leaders Al Hilal with Ronaldo's late rally securing all three points on the night in Riyadh. With 34 points from 14 matches, Al Nassr remain second on the table just behind Al Hilal, who have 35 points from 13 games.</b></p>
        <h2>BCB’s forward plan shadowy for fresh WTC cycle</h2>

        <p><b>Following ICC World Cup debacle, the spotlight shifts to Test cricket for Bangladesh as they kick off the third cycle of the World Test Championship (WTC) with a two-match Test series against New Zealand, beginning November 28 in Sylhet.</b></p>
        <p><b>Bangladesh dwelled at the bottom of the table in the two WTC cycles that preceded, and it appears the Tigers are likely to encounter significant obstacles in the coming season as well -- for they have to host South Africa and Sri Lanka and travel to India, Pakistan and West Indies, with the latter tour could likely be the least difficult assignment.</b></p>
        <h2>‘One of the most important wins’: Messi after Brazil’s first-ever loss at home in a WC qualifier</h2>
        <img src="https://sajidulhaqchy.github.io/hw1/images/arg.jpg">
        <p><b>Argentina captain Lionel Messi categorised their 1-0 win over Brazil at Rio de Janeiro's Maracana Stadium on Tuesday as "one of the most important wins that this group has achieved".</b></p>
        <p><b>Nicolas Otamendi's towering header separated the two archrivals in a bad-tempered World Cup qualifier that was delayed by half an hour after police clashed with fans at a sold-out Maracana Stadium.
