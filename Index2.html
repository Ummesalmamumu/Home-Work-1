    <h1>06 of the Most Beautiful Places in Bangladesh</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Bangladesh might be one of the world’s least-visited countries but that certainly doesn’t mean this south Asian nation is lacking in beauty.</h2>
    <p>The country is brimming with fascinating archaeological sites that reveal tales of ancient Bengal cities, mosques, Hindu temples and Buddhist viharas. From the treasures of Old Dhaka to the vast expanses of tea country, water-bound villages painted with lilies to the Chittagong Hill Tracts and the world’s longest sea beach, there are beautiful natural and urban landscapes around every corner</p>
    <h1>1.SHYLET</h1>
   
    <img src="./image/Sylhet.jpg"width="50%"> 
    <p><b>Located in the country’s far northeastern corner, Sylhet city is considered one of Bangladesh’s most important spiritual and cultural centres. The stomping ground of folk poets and chai merchants, Sylhet is also associated with verdant tea fields.
        The Surma River cuts through the centre of the city, with the iconic 19th-century Ali Amjad Clock overlooking the northern bank. Beyond the river and bridges, beautiful mosques dot the skyline, with the 14th-century saint Hazrat Shah Jalal being one of the most important pilgrimage sites.
        The Malnicherra Tea Estate and national parks to the north give the city a perennially green backdrop. Quite incredibly, Sylhet is responsible for producing the largest amount of tea in the country.

        <p><b>Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital city, is a thronging metropolis infamous for its traffic jams and swarming sidewalks. Its urban landscape is fascinating: modern masterpieces such as Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban, Bangladesh’s assembly building that was designed by Louis Kahn in 1982, throw the architecture in the oldest part of the city into even sharper contrast.
            Old Dhaka is the most beautiful part of the city. It’s home to countless heritage gems including the Mughal-era Lalbagh Fort, the 12th-century Hindu temple Dhakeshwari Mandir, and the pretty pink Ahsan Manzil Museum. Other key landmarks in Old Dhaka including Northbrook Hall (pictured), Ahsan Manzil, Ruplal House (a dilapidated merchant’s mansion) and the Church of the Holy Resurrection (an Armenian Apostolic church) tell the story of a storied metropolis with a far-ranging history and diverse cultural makeup.</b></p>
